            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Benjamin Lee, a student at the University of Virginia majoring in Computer Science and planning to graduate in Spring 2025. 
                Originally, when I came to UVA, my intention was to major in Chemistry. I had no interest in Computer Science, but I decided to take a class for fun. 
                During my first year, the class didn't meet my expectations, and I struggled heavily. However, this challenge motivated me even more to do better and pursue the topic. 
                I then realized that I wanted to fully commit to Computer Science as it mentally challenged me to be creative, solve problems, and collaborate with others. 
                Since then, the trajectory of my college life has changed for the better, taking more classes and electives that enhance my programming abilities and keep me passionate about the subject. <br><br>
                Outside of school, I love playing video games like League of Legends, Valorant, and Apex Legends with friends to stay in touch and take a break from studies. 
                I also enjoy story-driven games such as Insomniac's Spider-Man and Pokemon when playing solo. Soccer is another passion, and although I may not play as much now, 
                I aspire to play on a team for fun to maintain my skills and continue my love for the sport. Additionally, I've played the piano for almost fourteen years, 
                influencing my love for music across genres like pop, hip-hop, rap, or K-pop. <br><br>
                With my programming skills, I aspire to work as a software developer, whether in front-end or back-end development. 
                I appreciate any opportunity given to me and aim to continue working as a programmer to create something new that could help or inspire others in their 
                journey as a software developer or Computer Science major.
